# Battery_HIL
This project is about building a real controller, not a paper-only fantasy. The goal is to design a controller that can make decisions while dealing with uncertainty, especially uncertainty in the battery like degradation, capacity loss, and limited energy. The system is first modeled in Simulink, where the plant, constraints, and uncertainty live. Instead of pretending everything is perfectly known, the controller is designed to be risk-aware, using MPC-style ideas to balance performance, safety, and battery health.

Once the controller works in simulation, it is pushed onto an STM32F407 microcontroller and run in a hardware-in-the-loop setup. The MCU runs the control algorithm in real time and interacts with the Simulink model as if it were controlling a real system. This forces the design to respect real-world limits like timing, memory, and numerical stability. The point of the project is simple: learn control by building it end to end, from Simulink to embedded hardware, with uncertainty and risk treated as first-class citizens instead of inconvenient details.
